This new release of steam-bottler has a new directory structure. As I work more and more to fill the gaps in Wine Steam, I decided to go with a new directory structure. $HOME/.steam-bottler is the main folder with: steamclient, steamapps, userdata, and pfx.

This readme guides you on how you can migrate from 1.0.6 or below to 1.0.7, step by step.

First, rename your ~/.steam-bottler prefix to pfx. ```mv ~/.steam-bottler ~/pfx```

Now, make a new directory ```mkdir -p ~/.steam-bottler``` and move pfx into this directory. ```mv ~/.pfx ~/.steam-bottler/pfx```

We need to make 2 new directories now: ```mkdir -p ~/.steam-bottler/steamclient ~/.steam-bottler/userdata```

Run: 
```
mv ~/.steam-bottler/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser ~/.steam-bottler/userdata/steamuser
mv ~/.steam-bottler/pfx/drive_c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Steam/ ~/.steam-bottler/steamclient/Steam
ln -s ~/.steam-bottler/steamclient/Steam ~/.steam-bottler/pfx/drive_c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Steam/
ln -s ~/.steam-bottler/steamclient/Steam/Steamapps ~/.steam-bottler/steamapps
ln -s ~/.steam-bottler/userdata/steamuser ~/.steam-bottler/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser
```

Now, ```steam-bottler install``` (don't worry, your game data will be preserved)

And you should be all good.
