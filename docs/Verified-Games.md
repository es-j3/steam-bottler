Antimatter Dimensions | Proton 9.0.3 | 24.1.7.1 | N/A | Intel UHD Graphics 620 | 
A Game About Digging a Hole | Proton 20250203 (5213 Patch) | 24.1.7.1 | N/A | AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT | UE Game, therefore requires [5213 Patch](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/5213/diffs) for acceptable performance - Otherwise can be run with ```-ONETHREAD```, but the game won't run well.
BEAMNG.drive | Proton 20250203 (5213 Patch) | 24.1.7 | N/A | AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT | This game can be very hit-or-miss for people on FreeBSD.
Bloons TD 6 | Proton 20250203 (5213 Patch) | 24.1.7 | N/A | AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT |
Banana Shooter | Proton 20250203 (5213 Patch) | 24.1.7 | N/A | AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT |

Fallout Shelter | Proton 20250203 (5213 Patch)  | 24.1.7 | N/A | AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT | 
Garry's Mod | Proton 20250203 (5213 Patch)  | 24.1.7 | N/A | AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT | Must be launched with OSS for sound - otherwise great

Hearts of Iron IV | Proton 20250218 (5213 Patch) | 24.1.7 | N/A | AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT | Launcher doesn't work, game must be launched directly. Regular renderer has black map; switching to OpenGL fixes it.

PAYDAY 2 | Proton 20250203 (5213 Patch) | 24.1.7.1 | N/A | AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT | Must be launched with OSS for sound; audio crackling. Performance looks good, though.
